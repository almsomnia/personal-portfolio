                  Hi, I'm Riva Almero: a front-end developer, digital tinkerer,
                  and curious explorer of the web. My tools aren't just Vue,
                  React, and TypeScript &ndash; they're the lenses, lights, and
                  shutters I use to frame ideas into working applications.
               </p>
               <p className="leading-relaxed font-light text-pretty">
                  Every project begins as an empty frame. With the right
                  prespective, careful composition, and patience in editing, I
                  bring clarity and focus to what starts as abstract vision.
                  Like in photography, timing and balance matter &ndash; a
                  well-placed interaction, a subtle animation, or a clean layout
                  can transform a simple interface into something memorable.
               </p>
               <p className="leading-relaxed font-light text-pretty">
                  By day, I capture out of complexity in healthcare tech,
                  building applications that help medical professionals work
                  with clarity. By night, I step into my digital darkroom,
                  experimenting with side projects, tinkering with open-source,
                  or sharing snapshots of my journey as a developer.
               </p>
               <p className="leading-relaxed font-light text-pretty">
                  Outside of code, I chase light with my camera and rhythm with
                  my guitar &ndash; both keep me grounded, and both influence
                  the way I see and build for the web.
               </p>
               <p className="leading-relaxed font-light text-pretty">
                  Whether you need someone to frame your next idea, refine the
                  focus of your digital product, or just talk about photography,
                  music, and code &ndash; let's connect.
